# Wild-North
You will need an archive tool such as 7zip or Winzip to open this, but I recommend 7zip.
Select both WildNorth files by clicking while holding down control, and then right click on the files. Using 7zip in the context menu,
select "Extract Here".
If you have any trouble with this, you can also find the game on google drive at this link:

Then double click WildNorth.exe
If Windows throws an error, select "See Details" and then click "Run Anyway".
This error occurs because the publisher (us) is not verified with Windows.
Wild North is completely safe to play and has no viruses :)
Enjoy!
